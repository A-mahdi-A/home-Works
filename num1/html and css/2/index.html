    <div class="s-div">Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family
        Canidae. They
        have a flattened skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail
        ("brush").

        Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true fox" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or
        extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of
        the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island
        fox.[1]

        Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox
        (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes, together with their
        widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many
        societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe,
        especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.
        The word fox comes from Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic *fuhsaz.[nb 1] This in turn derives from
        Proto-Indo-European *puá¸±-, meaning 'thick-haired; tail'.[nb 2] Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards,
        females as vixens, and young as cubs, pups, or kits, though the last name is not to be confused with a distinct
        species called kit foxes. Vixen is one of very few words in modern English that retain the Middle English
        southern dialect "v" pronunciation instead of "f" (i.e. northern English "fox" versus southern English
        "vox").[3] A group of foxes is referred to as a skulk, leash, or earth.</div>
